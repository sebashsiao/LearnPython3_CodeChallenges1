    "In this code, we use a series of if, elif, and else statements. We test the first parameter against the other two parameters and return the value if it is greater than the other two. We have two more tests to check if the second parameter is greater than the other two, then if the third parameter is greater than the other two. In the case where none of the parameters were greater than both of the other parameters, then we know that there must have been a tie and the final return statement is reached."
